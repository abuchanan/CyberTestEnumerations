    <h1>CTE User Guide</h1>
    <div class="attribute">Cyber Test Enumerations (CTEs) are hierarchical and general concepts for designing cyber test and evaluation campaigns. CTEs are a decomposition of regulations and standards that are meant to be overlayed with system decomposition to design system verification objectives and overlayed with mission decomposition to design mission validation measures.</div>

    <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
    <div class="attribute">The purpose of CTEs are to enable cyber test planners to design credible test campaigns, enable integrated test, lower the barrier of entry for testers, and standardize cyber test design across organizations. Standardizing test design will create second order effects of easing trainig, making RFIs more clear, as well as making lab and range requirements less ambiguous.</div>

	<h2>2. Cyber Test Campaigns</h2>
    <div class="attribute">Cyber test campaigns are to be integrated with the overall test campaign. Campaign planning will consist of three main steps: test strategy brief, test design, then data management and analysis plan. The test strategy brief will cover the high level strategy to the test campaign. The test design will generate the questions that need to be answered in the form of objectives, critical operational issues, and measures. The test design is what the CTEs will primarily support. After the test design, the DMAP will identify the data elements that need to be collected in order to answer the questions identified in the test design. The CTEs will provide general data element recommendations, but it actual data elements should be tailored per system. Once campaign planning is drafted, the measures/objectives will be aggregated into activities, and those activities will be performed during events.</div>


    <h2>3. Usage</h2>
    <div class="attribute">CTEs are to be used to structure the test design process. Once a test strategy brief (TSB) has been performed, the test design processes starts. In an ideal world, all CTEs that can be applied to the system will be integrated into the test design. The test design items will then be prioritized through test concept briefs (TCBs).</div>
    <br/>
	<div class="attribute">System verification portion of the test design will be comprised of high level general test objectives (GTOs) which are broken out into specific test objectives (STOs) and then broken out into measurable and testable measures of performance (MOPs). The CTEs will assist in generating GTOs, STOs, and MOPs. An example being, if a test organization was requested to test the integration of an enterprise intrusion detection system in a DT&E context, then a GTO would be "Systems ability to detect cyber exploitation and attack" with STOs breaking down the specifics (such as log collection and network analysis) and MOPs that measure the coverage and relevance of PCAP, event logs, and other data elements.</div>
    <br/>
	<div class="attribute">TODO: Mission validation usage will be described at a later point.</div>
	
	
    <h3>3.1 Dependencies</h3>
    <div class="attribute">All CTEs that are applicable to the system should be tested. However, the use of developmental evaluation frameworks (DEF), operational evaluation frameworks (OEF), integrated decision support keys (IDSK), and fielding decision (FD) / operational acceptance (OA) criteria. Additionally, test design may also be influenced by contractor testing, independent testing, live testing, and lab testing.</div>
	
	<h3>3.2 Outputs</h3>
    <div class="attribute">If structuring the test design with the structure of the CTEs, then test design will identify the systems ability to prevent, detect, contain, mitigate, recover, and adapt. This will inform effectiveness, suitability, and survivability based decisions. By mapping the test design to CTEs, the planner can identify what has and has not been tested as well as if the system met the system and mission requirements.</div>

    <h2>4. Background</h2>
    <div class="attribute">Write an overview of the background of CTEs (how they were developed) and put the table that cross walks them.</div>
	
    <h3>4.1 CTE Creation</h3>
    <div class="attribute">Describe the regulation decomposition (DODM 5000.UY & CSEIG) then describe the items included in the crosswalk (enumerations, ATT&CK, D3FEND, CSF2, SPARTA) then describe the cooperative/adversarial relationship, then describe the SV vs MV, then describe </div>
